# UCSD-CSE152 introduction to computer vision
This is the course material of CSE152 in UCSD (homework) for education and discussion.

Note that github cannot upload files bigger than 25mb, so I delete all training data in hw1 and hw4. But the code and the result are recorded, and you can trainthe network or model by the code or use the model to predict directly. You can contact me if you need the data.
